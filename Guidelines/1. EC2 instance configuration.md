## EC2 instance configuration on AWS services
## Instance selection
Initially, it is necessary to choose the right instance for the deployment of MONAI Label, as there are minimum hardware requirements necessary for it to work properly.

The necessary requirements can be found in the repository of [MONAI Label](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel) 

## 1. Create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account

To access the cloud computing services, you will need to create your personal AWS account in your [oficial website](https://aws.amazon.com/es/) and clicking on the 'Login to Console' tab at the top right. There you will be able to fill in the new user data to access the console.

Additionally, check the prices of the services offered by AWS in its [pricing and free layer section](https://aws.amazon.com/es/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=categories%23desktop-app-streaming).

## 2. Learn how to use the AWS console

In order to familiarize yourself with the AWS environment and the basic handling of the console, you can watch the following videos:

Additionally, Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) services will be used, and the following video explains how it works:

## 3. Launching of the instance

With the previous knowledge of the previous steps, we will continue with the configuration of the instance used for this project. Initially, it will be necessary to search in the [AWS main console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1) el módulo EC2 y dar click en "Lanzar instancia".

- From there we will first configure the instance name and the OS image on which the instance will run:

- Subsequently, we will need to select the type of instance. For this project, due to the fact that a Deep Learning model will be trained with the MONAI tool, it will be necessary to select an instance type 'g' that has a dedicated graphics card, in this case an instance type 'g4dn.xlarge' was chosen, which has an NVIDIA T4 with 16Gb of GPU capacity:

***NOTE:*** To learn more about instance types, go to [official AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/es/ec2/instance-explorer/?ec2-instances-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.category-order&ec2-instances-cards.sort-order=desc&awsf.ec2-instances-filter-category=*all&awsf.ec2-instances-filter-processors=*all&awsf.ec2-instances-filter-accelerators=*all&awsf.ec2-instances-filter-additional-capabilities=*all&awsf.ec2-instances-filter-workload-tags=*all) que cuenta con la explicación detallada de cada una de ellas.

- With the above, it will be necessary to choose the network permissions, as well as to configure a private network if desired. In this case, an IP address 0.0.0.0.0 was left to facilitate access to the instance:

- As a last configuration, it will be necessary to choose the storage where all the data loaded in the instance will be stored. In this case, 50Gb of storage was chosen, but this will vary according to the amount of data available:

- Finally, the console will show us a summary with all the characteristics of the instance to verify that everything is according to the desired characteristics. Finally, if we are satisfied with the configuration we click on 'Launch Instance':

***NOTE:*** Once the instance is launched, the creation parameters can NOT be modified. If a different configuration is required, it will be necessary to delete the instance and create a new one from scratch.

## 4. Entry rule

As a last important step, it is necessary to open the input port through which our computer will transmit and receive the information. This can be done in the following tutorial to create a [new inbound rule](https://medium.com/@chiemelaumeh1/how-to-open-ports-inaws-ec2-server-68e576c641d6).

Following the previous steps, we will obtain a new rule that will look as follows and that will allow us to link the MONAI module in 3D Slicer with the EC2 instance:
