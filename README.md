## Problematic

- Prior to invasive procedures in interventional cardiology, it is difficult to understand the complex 3D anatomy of the heart from 2D images.
- Need for better visualization and diagnostic tools for the treatment of aortic coarctation.

## Main objective

- To develop a protocol for segmentation and visualization of 3D computed tomography images for diagnostic support of a congenital heart disease of interest to the CardioVID clinic.

## Specific objectives

- To construct a dataset of cardiac computed tomography images of subjects with aortic coarctation heart disease from the CardioVID clinic, considering inclusion and exclusion criteria by age and heart disease of interest.
- To develop a semi-automatic segmentation model for cardiac tomographic images in DICOM format using 3D Slicer software.
- To implement an interactive environment for the visualization and manipulation of cardiac 3D reconstructions.

## Workflow

The next image explain how there was the wrokflow for develop the project.
